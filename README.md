Brain_Tumor_Detection_Dataset_ML-Project
Introduction
The Brain Tumor Detection Dataset is a dataset created especially to identify brain cancers through
the use of cutting-edge computer vision methods. The project's primary objective is to aid in the
early diagnosis and detection of brain tumors, which will help medical professionals develop
efficient treatment programs. The collection includes a wide variety of meticulously annotated
brain tumor photos that show the specific labels associated tumor locations.
